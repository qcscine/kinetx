SCINE - KiNetx Python Bindings
==============================

Introduction
------------

This repository contains functionality which is used in SCINE to model reaction
kinetics and concentration flows in reaction networks.


Installation and Usage
----------------------

We currently offer only a ``manylinux2014`` build for Linux platforms. This may
be expanded in the future. If you are on a different platform, you can build 
the Python bindings from source (https://github.com/qcscine/kinetx/).
